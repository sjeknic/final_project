[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh///master?urlpath=rstudio)

This Final Project is designed to replicate the analysis contained
within “Genome-wide study of mRNA degradation and transcript elongation
in Escherichia coli”, specifically to replicate Figure 3a: Distributions
of lifetimes and elongation rates measured for exponentially growing
cells.

### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can clone the repository from this URL:
[final_project](https://github.com/sjeknic/final_project). After
unzipping: - open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio - run
`devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis
depends on (also listed in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).

## Usage

Use `simulate_walk` to simulate a Gaussian random walk. You can define
the length of the simulation in steps (`t`) and the mean (`mu`) and
standard deviation (`sigma`) of the distribution used in the simulation.

``` r
#library(simplerc)
#t <- 100
#mu <- 0.5
#sigma <- 2
#walk <- simulate_walk(t, mu, sigma)
```

To visualize the simulation, use the `plot_walk` function with the
output of `simulate_walk`.

``` r
#plot_walk(walk)
```

To estimate the parameters that were used for a simulation, use the
`fit_walk` function with the output from `simulate_walk`.

``` r
#params <- fit_walk(walk)
#params
```

#For the example above, the estimated parameters of *μ* = r params$mu
and *σ* = r params$sigma closely match the parameters used to generate
the simulation.

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

-   [:file_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
    and tables in this file)
-   [:file_folder: data](/analysis/data/raw_data): Data used in the
    analysis.
-   [:file_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations
-   [:file_folder:
    supplementary-materials](/analysis/supplementary-materials):
    Supplementary materials including notes and other documents prepared
    and collected during the analysis.
