abstract = {Abstract An essential part of gene expression is the coordination of RNA synthesis and degradation, which occurs in the same cellular compartment in bacteria. Here, we report a genome-wide RNA degradation study in Escherichia coli using RNA-seq, and present evidence that the stereotypical exponential RNA decay curve obtained using initiation inhibitor, rifampicin, consists of two phases: residual RNA synthesis, a delay in the interruption of steady state that is dependent on distance relative to the mRNA's 5â€² end, and the exponential decay. This gives a more accurate RNA lifetime and RNA polymerase elongation rate simultaneously genome-wide. Transcripts typically have a single RNA decay constant along all positions, which is distinct between different operons, indicating that RNA stability is unlikely determined by local sequences. These measurements allowed us to establish a model for RNA processing involving co-transcriptional degradation, providing quantitative description of the macromolecular coordination in gene expression in bacteria on a system-wide level.},
